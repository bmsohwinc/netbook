## Mobile telephone system
- 1G: analog voice
- 2G: digital voice
- 3G: digital voice and data

- 1G:
    - used 1-way transmitter
    - then came IMTS: 2-way transmitter running at different frequencies
    - then came AMPS
    - has a cell-based structure, with base station at center of each cell
    - proposes hand-off (hand-over?)
    - each cell has a different frequency than their neighbours

- 2G:
    - digitized, allows compression, encryption
    - GSM is the dominant system
        - wider freq range than AMPS
        - time division to include multiple mobile devices in a band
        - SIM cards for portable and secure communication
        - uses cells and base stations same as 1G

- 3G:
    - CDMA (code division multiple access) is the basis, an improvement over GSM
    - uses same frequency in all cells, unlike 1G/2G
    - proposes soft hand-off
        - bs1 + user
        - bs1 + user + bs2  --> user stays connected to old station during hand-off
        -       user + bs2
