## Points
- Metcalfe's Law
	- The value of a network is proportional to square of number of users
		- For `N` users, a network can have max of `N * (N - 1)` connections, hence the law

- P2P has no central server. Every node is a client/server
	- Email is inherently P2P

- RFID is battery-less, can communicate in a radius of few meters
- Sensor networks - constantly relay data to other nodes

- computer networks can be categorized into: 
	- **transmission technology**
	- **scale**

- transmission technology
	- Unicast
	- Multicast
	- Broadcast

- scale level
	- PAN - bluetooth
	- LAN - Wireless hotspots
		- WiFi is IEEE 802.11
	- MAN - Cable TV networks
